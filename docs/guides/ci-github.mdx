Run docdrift in GitHub Actions and see it work on GitHub.

## CI configuration

- Add secret: `DEVIN_API_KEY`
- Push to `main` or run `workflow_dispatch`
- Action uploads:
  - `.docdrift/drift_report.json`
  - `.docdrift/evidence/**`
  - `.docdrift/metrics.json`

## Run on GitHub

### 1. Create a repo

Create a repo on GitHub (e.g. `your-org/docdrift`), then add the remote and push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/docdrift.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Add secret

Repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

- Name: `DEVIN_API_KEY`
- Value: your Devin API key (same as in `.env` locally)

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically; the workflow uses it for commit comments and issues.

### 3. Trigger the workflow

- **Push to `main`** — runs on every push (compares previous commit vs current).
- **Manual run** — **Actions** tab → **devin-doc-drift** → **Run workflow** (uses `HEAD` and `HEAD^` as head/base).

## See it work (demo on GitHub)

This repo has **intentional drift**: the API has been expanded (new fields `fullName`, `avatarUrl`, `createdAt`, `role` and new endpoint `GET /v1/users` with pagination), but **docs are unchanged** (`docs/reference/openapi.json` and `docs/reference/api.md` still describe the old single-endpoint, `id`/`name`/`email` only). Running docdrift will detect that and hand a large diff to Devin to fix via a PR. To see it:

1. **Create a new GitHub repo** (e.g. `docdrift-demo`) so you have a clean place to run the workflow.
2. **Push this project with full history** (so both commits are on `main`):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/docdrift-demo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. **Add secret** in that repo: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → `DEVIN_API_KEY` = your Devin API key.
4. **Trigger the workflow**
   - Either push another small commit (e.g. README tweak), or
   - **Actions** → **devin-doc-drift** → **Run workflow**.
5. **Where to look**
   - **Actions** → open the run → **Run Doc Drift** step: the step logs print JSON with `sessionUrl`, `prUrl`, and `outcome` per doc area. Open any `sessionUrl` in your browser to see the Devin session.
   - **Artifacts**: download **docdrift-artifacts** for `.docdrift/drift_report.json`, `.docdrift/metrics.json`, and evidence.
   - **Devin dashboard**: sessions are tagged `docdrift`; you'll see the run there once the step completes (often 1–3 minutes).
