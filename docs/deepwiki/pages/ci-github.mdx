# CI and GitHub Setup

Run docdrift in GitHub Actions and see it work on GitHub.

## CI Configuration

- Add secret: `DEVIN_API_KEY`
- Push to `main` or run `workflow_dispatch`
- Action uploads:
  - `.docdrift/drift_report.json`
  - `.docdrift/evidence/**`
  - `.docdrift/metrics.json`

## Run on GitHub

### 1. Create a Repo

Create a repo on GitHub (e.g. `your-org/docdrift`), then add the remote and push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/docdrift.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Add Secret

Repo Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret

- Name: `DEVIN_API_KEY`
- Value: your Devin API key (same as in `.env` locally)

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically; the workflow uses it for commit comments and issues.

### 3. Trigger the Workflow

- **Push to `main`** — runs on every push (compares previous commit vs current).
- **Manual run** — Actions tab > devin-doc-drift > Run workflow (uses `HEAD` and `HEAD^` as head/base).

## See It Work (Demo on GitHub)

This repo has **intentional drift**: the API has been expanded (new fields `fullName`, `avatarUrl`, `createdAt`, `role` and new endpoint `GET /v1/users` with pagination), but **docs are unchanged**. Running docdrift will detect that and hand a large diff to Devin to fix via a PR.

1. **Create a new GitHub repo** (e.g. `docdrift-demo`) so you have a clean place to run the workflow.
2. **Push this project with full history** so both commits are on `main`.
3. **Add secret** in that repo: Settings > Secrets > `DEVIN_API_KEY`.
4. **Trigger the workflow** — push a commit or use manual dispatch.
5. **Where to look**:
   - Actions > open the run > Run Doc Drift step: logs print JSON with `sessionUrl`, `prUrl`, and `outcome`.
   - Artifacts: download docdrift-artifacts for reports and evidence.
   - Devin dashboard: sessions are tagged `docdrift`.
