## Purpose and Philosophy

The MCP TypeScript SDK follows a **discuss-first, code-second** approach to contributions. This philosophy ensures that:

- New features align with the SDK's goals before implementation effort is invested
- Complex changes are architecturally sound before code review
- The small maintainer team can effectively review and support merged features
- Contributors avoid wasted effort on features that may not be accepted

**Key principle**: Every merged feature becomes an ongoing maintenance burden. Prior discussion helps determine whether something belongs in the SDK.

## Issue Workflow

### When to Open an Issue

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["Contribution Idea"]
    
    Start --> CheckSignificance{"Is change<br/>significant?"}
    
    CheckSignificance -->|"Yes:<br/>New APIs<br/>Architecture changes<br/>Multi-module changes"| OpenIssue["Open Issue First"]
    CheckSignificance -->|"No:<br/>Simple bug fix<br/>Few lines + tests"| DirectPR["Can open PR directly"]
    
    OpenIssue --> DiscussIssue["Discuss approach<br/>with maintainers"]
    
    DiscussIssue --> Approved{"Issue<br/>approved?"}
    
    Approved -->|"Yes"| AssignIssue["Comment on issue<br/>to get assigned"]
    Approved -->|"No"| Closed["Issue closed"]
    
    AssignIssue --> CodeWork["Implement changes"]
    DirectPR --> CodeWork
    
    CodeWork --> OpenPR["Open Pull Request"]
    
    OpenPR --> Review["Code Review"]
    
    Review --> Merge["Merged"]
    
    style OpenIssue fill:#f0f0f0
    style AssignIssue fill:#f0f0f0
    style Merge fill:#e0e0e0
```

**What counts as "significant"**:
- New public APIs or classes
- Architectural changes or refactoring
- Changes touching multiple modules
- Features requiring spec changes (these need a [SEP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) first)

**Straightforward bug fixes** (a few lines of code with tests demonstrating the fix) can skip the issue step. For complex bugs requiring significant changes, consider opening an issue first.

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:7-23]()

### Writing Effective Issues

**Good issues include**:
- Clear problem statement leading with what's broken or needed
- Runnable code demonstrating the problem
- Focused scope - one clear problem per issue
- Evidence of upfront debugging effort

**Issues that will be closed**:
- Low-effort submissions without investigation
- Obviously AI-generated content
- Vague problem descriptions without context

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:24-32]()

### Finding Issues to Work On

| Label | Audience | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `good first issue` | Newcomers | Can tackle without deep codebase knowledge |
| `help wanted` | Experienced contributors | Maintainers probably won't get to this |
| `ready for work` | Maintainers | Triaged and ready for maintainer pickup |

**Labels indicating NOT ready for work**:
- `needs confirmation` - Requires reproduction verification
- `needs repro` - Missing reproduction steps
- `needs design` - Architectural approach undefined

**Before starting work**: Comment on the issue to request assignment. This prevents duplicate effort and signals to other contributors.

## Pull Request Process

### Branch Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Version Branches"
        Main["main<br/>(v2 development)"]
        V1X["v1.x<br/>(v1 stable)"]
    end
    
    subgraph "PR Targets"
        NewFeature["New Features"]
        V2Work["v2 Changes"]
        V1BugFix["v1 Bug Fixes"]
        V1Patches["v1 Patches"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Base Selection"
        BaseMain["Base on main"]
        BaseV1X["Base on v1.x"]
    end
    
    NewFeature --> BaseMain
    V2Work --> BaseMain
    V1BugFix --> BaseV1X
    V1Patches --> BaseV1X
    
    BaseMain --> Main
    BaseV1X --> V1X
    
    style Main fill:#f0f0f0
    style V1X fill:#f0f0f0
```

The repository maintains two main branches:

- **`main`** - v2 SDK development (monorepo with split packages)
- **`v1.x`** - Stable v1 release for bug fixes and patches

**Branch selection rules**:
- For **new features** or **v2-related work**: base PR on `main`
- For **v1 bug fixes** or **patches**: base PR on `v1.x`

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:50-60]()

### Pull Request Scope

**Small PRs get reviewed fast. Large PRs sit in the queue.**

The review burden scales non-linearly:
- **Few dozen lines**: Reviewed in minutes
- **Hundreds of lines across many files**: Requires significant verification effort, things slip through

**For large changes**:
- Break into a stack of smaller PRs, OR
- Get explicit maintainer alignment on approach in an issue before submitting

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:62-67]()

### Rejection Criteria

PRs may be rejected for:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Lack of prior discussion** | Features or significant changes without an approved issue |
| **Scope creep** | Changes beyond what was discussed or unrequested features |
| **Misalignment with SDK direction** | Well-implemented features that don't fit SDK goals |
| **Insufficient quality** | Code not meeting clarity, maintainability, or style standards |
| **Overengineering** | Unnecessary complexity or abstraction for simple problems |

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:69-78]()

### Submission Checklist

When submitting a PR:

1. ✓ Follow existing code style ([`.eslintrc.json`](), [`.prettierrc`]())
2. ✓ Include tests for new functionality
3. ✓ Update documentation as needed
4. ✓ Keep changes focused and atomic
5. ✓ Provide clear description of changes
6. ✓ Ensure "what" and "why" were settled in prior issue discussion

## Development Workflow

### Day-to-Day Development

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["Start work"]
    
    Start --> CreateBranch["Create feature branch<br/>from main or v1.x"]
    
    CreateBranch --> MakeChanges["Make code changes"]
    
    MakeChanges --> RunLint["pnpm lint:all"]
    
    RunLint --> LintPassed{"Linting<br/>passed?"}
    
    LintPassed -->|"No"| FixLint["Fix linting errors"]
    FixLint --> RunLint
    
    LintPassed -->|"Yes"| RunTests["pnpm test:all"]
    
    RunTests --> TestsPassed{"Tests<br/>passed?"}

    FixTests --> RunTests
    
    TestsPassed -->|"Yes"| SubmitPR["Submit Pull Request"]
    
    style SubmitPR fill:#e0e0e0
```

**Standard workflow**:
1. Create a new branch for changes (based on `main` or `v1.x`)
2. Make code changes
3. Run `pnpm lint:all` to ensure code style compliance
4. Run `pnpm test:all` to verify all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:105-111]()

### Running Examples

The SDK includes runnable examples for both servers and clients. See [`examples/server/README.md`]() and [`examples/client/README.md`]() for complete lists.

**Quick start**:

```bash
# Run a server example
pnpm --filter @modelcontextprotocol/examples-server exec tsx src/simpleStreamableHttp.ts

# Run a client example (in another terminal)
pnpm --filter @modelcontextprotocol/examples-client exec tsx src/simpleStreamableHttp.ts
```

## Release Management (v1.x)

### v1.x Release Workflow

Contributors may need to understand the v1.x release process for backporting fixes or maintaining older versions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{"Release type?"}
    
    Start -->|"Latest v1.x<br/>(e.g., v1.25.3)"| LatestV1["Checkout v1.x branch"]
    Start -->|"Older minor<br/>(e.g., v1.23.2)"| OlderMinor["Checkout release branch<br/>from tag"]
    
    LatestV1 --> ApplyFix1["Apply fix or<br/>cherry-pick commits"]
    OlderMinor --> CreateBranch["git checkout -b release/1.23 v1.23.1"]
    
    CreateBranch --> ApplyFix2["Cherry-pick or<br/>manual fixes"]
    
    ApplyFix1 --> BumpLatest["npm version patch<br/>(creates tag)"]
    ApplyFix2 --> BumpOlder["npm version patch<br/>(creates tag)"]
    
    BumpLatest --> PushLatest["git push origin v1.x --tags"]
    BumpOlder --> PushOlder["git push origin release/1.23 --tags"]
    
    PushLatest --> AutoRelease["Automatic workflow<br/>triggered by tag"]
    PushOlder --> ManualRelease["Manual workflow<br/>trigger from GitHub Actions"]
    
    AutoRelease --> Published["Published to npm"]
    ManualRelease --> Published
    
    Published --> NPMTag["npm tag:<br/>release-X.Y"]
    
    style Published fill:#e0e0e0
```

### Latest v1.x Release (e.g., v1.25.3)

```bash
git checkout v1.x
git pull origin v1.x
# Apply your fix or cherry-pick commits
npm version patch      # Bumps version and creates tag (e.g., v1.25.3)
git push origin v1.x --tags
```

The tag push automatically triggers the [`release-v1x.yml`]() workflow.

### Older Minor Versions (e.g., v1.23.2)

For patching older minor versions not on the `v1.x` branch:

```bash
# 1. Create a release branch from the last release tag
git checkout -b release/1.23 v1.23.1

# 2. Apply your fixes (cherry-pick or manual)
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# 3. Bump version and push
npm version patch      # Creates v1.23.2 tag
git push origin release/1.23 --tags
```

Then manually trigger the "Publish v1.x" workflow from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/actions/workflows/release-v1x.yml), specifying the tag (e.g., `v1.23.2`).

### npm Tag Strategy

v1.x releases are published with `release-X.Y` npm tags (e.g., `release-1.25`), **not** `latest`. This allows users to pin to specific minor versions:

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@release-1.25
```

**Sources**: [CONTRIBUTING.md:127-168](), [.github/workflows/release-v1x.yml:1-106]()

## Quality Standards

### Code Style Requirements

The SDK enforces consistent code style through:

- **ESLint**: Linting rules defined in `.eslintrc.json`
- **Prettier**: Formatting rules defined in `.prettierrc`
- **TypeScript**: Type checking via `tsconfig.json` configurations

All code must pass:
```bash
pnpm lint:all      # ESLint + Prettier checks
pnpm typecheck:all # TypeScript validation
```

### Testing Requirements

**All new functionality must include tests**:
- Unit tests for individual functions/classes
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Conformance tests for protocol compliance (see [Conformance Testing](#8.2))

Run tests:
```bash
pnpm test:all                    # All tests
pnpm test:conformance:client     # Client conformance
pnpm test:conformance:server     # Server conformance
```

### Documentation Requirements

Contributors should update documentation when:
- Adding new public APIs
- Changing existing behavior
- Adding new features or capabilities
- Fixing bugs that affect documented behavior
