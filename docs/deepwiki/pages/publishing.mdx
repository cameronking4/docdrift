# Publishing the Package

Publish `@devinnn/docdrift` to npm for use in other repos.

## Steps

1. Set `"private": false` in `package.json` (or omit it).
2. Set `"repository": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/your-org/docdrift.git" }`.
3. Run `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`), then `npm publish`.
4. For scoped packages: `npm publish --access public`.

Only the `dist/` directory is included (`files` in `package.json`). Consumers get the built CLI; they provide their own `docdrift.yaml` in their repo.
