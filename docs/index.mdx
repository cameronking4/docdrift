DocDrift is an opinionated policy engine and Devin harness for documentation drift: it detects when code and docs have diverged, decides when to fix vs escalate, and controls Devin so you get one session and one PR—not a flood of doc updates. You run it via CLI or GitHub Actions. No generic “detect drift” pipeline; we gate on real signal, bundle evidence, and keep noise low by design.

## The problem: Client E (DataStack)

**Client E (DataStack):** *"We can't keep our internal docs or API references up to date. Our API docs are six months out of date. Engineers change endpoints and never update the docs. New hires and partner teams constantly ping us asking how things work because the docs are wrong. We know it's a problem but writing docs is the first thing that gets cut from any sprint."*

That’s the reality for many teams: docs slip, support load goes up, and onboarding slows down. The fix isn’t “write more docs”—it’s **detect drift from real code, then remediate in one place** so you save time (fewer “how does this work?” pings, less manual catch-up) and money (faster onboarding, fewer mistakes from stale docs).

## How DocDrift solves it

We **detect** by comparing generated API spec (from code) to what’s published in docs, plus optional path-based heuristics. Runs trigger on merge (GitHub Actions) or on demand (CLI). **We only run when there’s real drift:** in STRICT mode we gate on spec diff—no spec change means no Devin session, so you’re not flooded with runs.

The **policy engine** then **decides**: open a Devin session for a PR, open an issue for human judgment, or no-op. We enforce **idempotency** (same run doesn’t create duplicate work), **confidence gating**, and a **daily PR cap** so you never get buried in doc PRs.

**Remediation** is Devin with an **evidence bundle**—actual code, diffs, and impacted docs—updating only allowlisted paths. **One session, one PR** for the whole docsite. No doc-PR spam; **allowlist/exclude** so Devin only touches what you approve.

**API refs vs conceptual docs:** For API-first teams (“our API docs are six months out of date”), **STRICT mode** gates on spec diff only: no spec drift → no session. We only act when the spec actually changed. For conceptual guides, **AUTO mode** plus **path mappings** (e.g. `apps/api/src/auth/**` → guides) signals when code might have outrun the prose; we **escalate to an issue** or **requireHumanReview** so a human decides—no silent rewrites of guides. **7-day SLA:** stale doc-drift PRs get a reminder via `sla-check`. One **lightweight YAML** (`docdrift.yaml`) keeps adoption simple. (Surfacing: single session/PR, cap, requireHumanReview, confidence, allowlist, idempotency—all built in.)

## How you run it

**Quick Start** — Run in under 2 minutes with the npm package (no clone required):

```bash
npx @devinnn/docdrift setup          # or generate-yaml for scriptable config
npx @devinnn/docdrift validate       # verify config and commands
npx @devinnn/docdrift detect         # detection only (optional: --base / --head)
npx @devinnn/docdrift run            # full run (set DEVIN_API_KEY, GITHUB_* for CI)
```

Add repo secret `DEVIN_API_KEY` for GitHub Actions. **CLI** for local and scripted use: `validate`, `detect`, `run`, `setup`, `generate-yaml`, `export`, `sla-check`, `status`. **GitHub Actions** for drift on push and **pull request** (on PR, Devin commits to the source branch by default; see [Configuration](/guides/configuration)). See **[Getting Started](/getting-started)** and **[GitHub Actions](/github-actions)**.

## What else is in the box

Evidence bundle (drift report + diffs + impacted docs) so Devin fixes from real code; verification commands; DeepWiki export to static MDX; `setup` / `generate-yaml` for bootstrap; `status` and `sla-check` for visibility. All of it fits the same policy: detect once, decide clearly, remediate with low noise.
