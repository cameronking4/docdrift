DataStack documentation: API reference (generated from OpenAPI) and guides.

## API Reference

The [API Reference](/docs/api/datastack-api) is generated from the OpenAPI spec. When the API code changes, docdrift detects drift and updates the published spec; this docsite regenerates the reference pages and builds to verify.
