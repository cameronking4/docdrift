# DocDrift custom instructions

- **PR titles:** When opening a docdrift PR (separate-pr or push), start the title with `[docdrift]`.
- **Commit-to-branch:** When committing directly to the source PR branch, use clear commit messages; no separate PR is opened.
- **PR descriptions:** Include emojis and a clear description of changes from an **end-user perspective** (someone reading the docs site). Explain what changed in the docs and why it matters to readers.
